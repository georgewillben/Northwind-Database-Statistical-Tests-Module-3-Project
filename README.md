This is George Bennett's Module 3 project for Flat Iron School.
In this project I answer for questions using statistical tests.

In this repository you can find:
A jupyter notebook containing code for the project (Student.ipynb)
An "Executive Summary" Slide show presentation saved as a pdf (Non_Technical_Presentation.pdf)
The Northwind database (Northwind_small.sqlite)
Pictures of the ERD for the Northwind database (Northwind_ERD.png, Northwind_ERD_updated.png)
A grading rubric for the project (module3_project_rubric.pdf)
